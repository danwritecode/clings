// Welcome to clings!
// This first exercise is just to show you how things work.
// 
// There are two ways an exercise could be failing: 
// 1. Compilation Error
// 2. Runtime Error
//
// Your goal is to complete an exercise and get it to both compile and also to run with no errors
// while following the directions of the exercise. 
//
// Once there are no errors and you're ready to move on, delete the "I AM NOT DONE" line.
