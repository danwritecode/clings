Welcome to clings!

clings is an interactive course to help you learn C entirely through the terminal and your text editor.

Each exercise will due to 1 or both of the following reasons:
1. A compilation error
2. A runtime error

For each exercise, your mission is simple: fix the errors you encounter.

Once all errors have been fixed, the program will automatically move you to the next exercise.

Good luck and have fun!
