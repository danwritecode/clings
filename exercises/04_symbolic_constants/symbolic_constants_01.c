/*
 * In programming, hardcoding numbers directly into your code 
 * (often referred to as "magic numbers") can make the code less 
 * understandable and harder to maintain.
 *
 * Using symbolic constants can help alleviate these issues by 
 * providing meaningful names for these numbers.
 * 
 * Below is a simple C program that prints a Fahrenheit-to-Celsius 
 * conversion table. The program currently uses magic numbers. 
 * Your task is to refactor this program to use symbolic constants.
 *
 * Example macro definition:
 * #define PI 3.14159
 *
 * Example usage:
 * double circumference = 2 * PI * radius;
